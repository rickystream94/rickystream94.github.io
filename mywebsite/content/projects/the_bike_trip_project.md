Combining a passion for cycling with an elective course on data analysis and visualization offered by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in the summer of 2017, my dear friend and former university mate Angelos has founded the [_Bike Trip Project_](https://www.instagram.com/thebiketripproject).
This project involved an epic cycling adventure from Tallinn, Estonia to Istanbul, Turkey, with a twist: meticulously tracking weather and location data along the way.
The data collection was made possible thanks to a custom Android app I developed specifically for the project.

This data became the fuel for insightful visualizations, allowing him to analyze and share the story of his journey in a whole new way.
