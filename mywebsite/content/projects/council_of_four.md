_Council of Four_ (translated from the Italian version _Il Consiglio dei 4_) is a strategy board game published by [Cranio Creations](https://www.craniocreations.it/).
This online multiplayer video game was developed as the final project for the Software Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano. Students were divided into groups (including myself) to create the game, inspired by the aforementioned board game. It also served as my Bachelor's Degree final project.
