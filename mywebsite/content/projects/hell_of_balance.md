This project explored the potential of combining the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) with [**Microsoft Kinect V2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) to create a rehabilitation tool prototype named _Hell of Balance_.
This gamified experience aims to motivate patients with balance and motion control impairments while assessing their progress during rehabilitation exercises.

The application was developed as part of the final project for the [Healthcare Technology](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2017-2018/02515) course (Technical University of Denmark, AY 2017/18).

## Bonus Exercise with Microsoft Kinect

In an attempt to test the integration between Unity and Kinect, as part of the same course, we were asked to develop a revised version of the classic _Space Shooter_ game, where hand gestures completely replaced the traditional keyboard controls for spaceship movement.
