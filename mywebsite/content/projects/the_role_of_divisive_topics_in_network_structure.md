_The Role of Divisive Topics in Network Structure_, is a large-scale analysis of controversial online conversations with socio-political backgrounds and contexts on Twitter.
It aims at modeling the long-term effect of ideological polarization in mutually interacting users on social media platforms.

## Abstract
> Ideological polarization on social media reflects a crucial issue of contemporary societies.
> Several studies within social sciences and psychology tried to investigate the root causes and formulated theories to describe this phenomenon.
> Information retrieval through social media platforms like Twitter has the means to hinder a democratic approach towards political debates. This aspect fosters the creation of echo chambers that enhance the spreading and reinforcement of polarized opinions among ideologically similar individuals.
> The aim of this study was to find a scientific way to measure the impact of controversial topics on Twitter users' behavior from a temporal perspective.
> By relying on third-party software and the Twitter Developer API, I collected a set of raw tweets from Twitter related to political controversies that took place between September 2013 and December 2016. Each controversy was related to a set of hashtags conventionally adopted by the users to express their political affiliation.
> A large network of Twitter users, mutually interacting in the same time window, along with the collection of tweets designated the subject of the study.
> I revealed evidence of a positive bonding effect on Twitter users mutually communicating as part of the global conversations represented by such controversial hashtags.
> This reflected into an increase of the mutual interaction consistency in both the short and long term, fostered by the online controversies.
> I further discovered that the mutual interactions network obeyed the laws of a precise topological structure which highlighted the presence of community clusters growing around the most influential users.
> The obtained results hinted the existence of the echo chamber phenomenon. The role of the community hubs and the high in-community communication suggests a clear resemblance of a realistic political debate between opposing groups.
> Further investigation within NLP suggested that predicting tweets' political leaning is a viable task.
