# Purpose

I'll be using this repository as a personal home page to:

- Host project related websites;
- Host any sort of script, coding experiment and similar that didn't grow enough to deserve a standalone repo (yet) :)

## Social Graphs & Interactions - Final Assignment Website

- [Website URL](https://rickystream94.github.io/social_graphs/)
- Description: The *Social Graphs & Interactions* was a course offered by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). As part of the final hand in, students were asked to build a website to showcase, in a user friendly way, technical concepts about networks and natural language processing. Each group had chosen a specific topic and dataset to work on, and my project focused on the universe of characters and places from *The Lord of the Rings*.
