# Riccardo Cannistr√†: Personal Repository
Hi all, I'll be hosting in this repository some personal projects, websites and whatever might be useful!

Enjoy!

Current content:

1. **Social Graphs & Interactions Project Website**: the official website of this course, held by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The website is meant to be a way to present in a user friendly way some technical concepts about networks and text mining. The topic of the project is *The Lord of the Rings*, so it might be interesting to have a look! Please follow directly [this link](https://www.rickystream94.github.io/social_graphs) to visit the website!
